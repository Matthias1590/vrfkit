# Legacy replay support investigation, 2026-09-24

**Status: container inspection is implemented; payload decoding is not.**
Builds 11.06 through 12.09 still fail closed in `validate`, `diag` and `export`.
Do not count them as supported decoding builds or close issue #14 on the
strength of the header change.

## Replay evidence

The 48 samples are from
[`Matthias1590/unsupported-replays`](https://github.com/Matthias1590/unsupported-replays/tree/c5ba8419b96afa8e88e7afb3e594cf4cce9c75fe):
three per build, 11.06--11.11 and 12.00--12.09. The downloaded `.replay` files
were renamed `.vrf` without changing their bytes. The repository's SHA-256
manifest identifies the source payloads.

Before the fix, `inspect` failed on all 36 samples through 12.05. The first
four builds ran past the end of the header, while larger headers from 11.10
onward reached an invalid level-name count. All twelve samples from
12.06--12.09 already passed inspection but were rejected for missing payload
transforms.

The legacy header places UE4Version directly after the replay branch string:
the next three little-endian u32 values are 522, 1009 and 77. The current
reader instead interpreted 522 as the length of a VALORANT extension. The
extension's length and bytes first appear in the 12.06 samples. Reading it
only outside the twelve measured legacy branches restores the correct
package-version, level-name, game-specific-data and recording-parameter
boundaries. Malformed modern headers are not retried with the legacy layout.

After the fix, all 48 samples pass inspection and the container corpus smoke
test. That smoke test also decompresses the first ReplayData chunk and checks
known Event layouts; it does not decode replication payloads. Synthetic
regressions cover every legacy branch, the 12.06 boundary, zero/nonzero
extensions and rejection of missing modern extensions. The legacy regression
was run against the original reader and failed on the same misplaced length.

## Remaining decoder dependency

A temporary identity-transform probe was run on `sample-1` from every build.
All sixteen validations failed, with framing oracle rates of only
0.711762%--3.804203%. The experimental registrations were removed. Neither
plaintext passthrough nor merely accepting the branch is a decoding fix.

The upstream parser at
[`2b66c65`](https://github.com/michel-giehl/ValorantReplayParser/tree/2b66c65a7b116154e18ebb84d9f6795f2b080233/src/Replay.Encoding/PayloadEncryption/VersionedTransforms)
has transforms only for the same eight builds vrfkit already supports.
Deriving and verifying the missing transforms needs their implementation or
the relevant archived game executables. The upstream maintainer describes
locating the transformed reader through `UActorChannel::ReadContentBlockHeader`
in [issue #2](https://github.com/michel-giehl/ValorantReplayParser/issues/2).

Each new transform must come with independent expected-byte vectors, followed
by validation and checkpoint-enabled export of all three available samples
for its build. Frame success alone is not evidence that typed values agree
with the wire.

## Regression scope and commands

Eight previously supported builds were checked before and after this change:
12.10, 12.11, 13.00, 13.01, 13.02, 13.04, 13.05 and 13.06, one replay each.
All validations and checkpoint-enabled exports passed. All 104 Parquet files
(13 per replay) were byte-identical between the two binaries.

The baseline binary was built from `18a0c607ff85cbd7cc785210dbc9add1d6e6e166`.
To repeat the legacy container checks, set `VRFKIT_CORPUS_DIR` to one build's
directory and require that it exists:

```powershell
$env:VRFKIT_CORPUS_DIR = '<replay-root>/11.06'
$env:VRFKIT_REQUIRE_CORPUS = '1'
cargo +1.86.0 test -p vrf-container --test corpus parse_all_vrf_files --locked -- --exact --nocapture
vrfkit inspect '<replay-root>/11.06/sample-1.vrf' --redact-identifiers
vrfkit validate '<replay-root>/11.06/sample-1.vrf' # expected: unsupported branch
```

Repeat for every affected directory. For the supported-build comparison, run
both binaries on the same replay with `validate` and
`export <replay> --out <separate-directory> --checkpoints`, then compare the
SHA-256 of each output Parquet file. Replay bytes and local export bundles are
not committed.
